# Command-Line Rust

## About

This repository contains the projects from the book *Command-Line Rust: A
Project-Based Primer for Writing Rust CLIs* by Ken Youens-Clark (2022). I write
the projects (and make the neccessary adjustments for deprecated features
especially in the crates used in the projects) as I read the book mainly to
learn Rust.

## Disclaimer

Virtually all the source code in this repository are from the book and should be
credited to the author of the book. I am only storing the projects in the
repository and tracking them with git to sort of document my learning process
via the commits.
